> Based on my interests and career aspirations, I began self-studying web development in March 2022. I officially enrolled in AlphaCamp in August 2022 and graduated in late June 2023 ([CERTIFICATE OF COMPLETION](https://lighthouse.alphacamp.co/certificates/57df8514-a4de-4874-b0c0-5f3900ee282e)). I am now a junior engineer. Any side projects I develop will be posted here. Thank you for taking the time to read this introduction. Have a wonderful day !!
